# README

Hello! If you're coming along to my workshop on Friday, you'll want to check that you've got a couple of things ready to go - and that you want to come :)

## Overview

I'll be giving an introduction to the Freya programming model, and working through an example of implementing an API using Freya.

## Requirements

* My LambdaConf repository (https://github.com/kolektiv/lambdaconf), cloned locally.
* Visual Studio 2013 (or an equivalent development environment - something that understands Visual Studio .sln files, and how to build them when they contain F# projects). You may be able to happily use something like MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio, but if you do, please check that you can build the solution before the workshop - I probably won't know how to fix a problem with some unseen environment!
* A web browser (you're not Richard Stallman, so you have this one) and an internet connection - fingers crossed for conference wi-fi!
